# Design Work
## ðŸ›  UI Implementation Overview
- Implemented two-column responsive grid layout using CSS Grid with lg:grid-cols-2 for desktop and stacked mobile layout
- Created mixed typography effect for "ABOUT ME" heading with solid white "ABOUT" and outlined black "ME" text
- Applied custom CSS module styling for text-stroke outline effect with fallback support for older browsers
- Integrated grayscale filter on portrait image to match the black and white aesthetic from Figma
- Used responsive typography scaling from text-6xl to text-8xl across breakpoints for proper heading hierarchy
- Implemented proper spacing with container mx-auto, padding utilities, and gap-8 lg:gap-16 for column separation
- Added order utilities (order-1/order-2) to control mobile stacking with image first, text second
- Applied Inter and Goldman fonts via CSS imports with proper font-smoothing for crisp text rendering

## ðŸ§  User-Defined Business Logic Summary
- Single-state about section with two-column design featuring large mixed typography heading and portrait photo
- Content should be configurable via props or CMS with support for dynamic text and image replacement
- Responsive behavior transitions from two-column desktop to vertically stacked mobile layout
- Image optimization considerations include lazy loading and maintaining consistent aspect ratios
- Accessibility requirements include descriptive alt text, proper heading hierarchy, and sufficient contrast
- Typography hierarchy maintains heading prominence across all screen sizes with mixed solid/outlined styling
- Performance optimization focuses on image loading with skeleton states for better user experience
- Component accepts props for aboutText, portraitImage object, and configurable headingLevel

## ðŸ¤– Inferred Business Logic Summary (LLM)
- AnimatedText component integration provides staggered text reveal animations with fadeInRight effect
- CSS animation system includes textReveal keyframes for paragraph content with 0.5s delay timing
- Font loading strategy uses Google Fonts CDN with display=swap for optimal performance
- Image handling includes object-cover positioning and lazy loading attribute for performance
- Responsive design breakpoints follow mobile-first approach with md: and lg: prefixes
- Text rendering optimization includes antialiasing and optimizeLegibility properties
- Fallback styling system provides text-shadow alternative for browsers without text-stroke support
- Component structure follows functional component pattern with default export convention

## âœ… Remaining Implementation Tasks
- Create or import the AnimatedText component referenced in the code but not provided
- Add the portrait image asset (13_7.png) to the correct assets directory structure
- Configure Tailwind CSS to recognize custom font classes or update to use CSS module classes
- Implement proper error handling for missing image assets with fallback placeholder
- Add PropTypes or TypeScript interfaces for component props validation
- Create unit tests following project standards using React Testing Library
- Optimize CSS module imports to follow project's Tailwind-first approach
- Consider implementing skeleton loading states for image and text content
