- Implemented two-column responsive layout using CSS Grid with lg:grid-cols-2 for desktop and grid-cols-1 for mobile
- Created large typography for "ABOUT ME" heading using text-5xl to xl:text-[88px] with responsive scaling
- Applied outlined text effect to "ME" using WebkitTextStroke and transparent color for visual contrast
- Integrated grayscale filter on portrait image to match the black and white design aesthetic
- Used dark background (bg-gray-900) with white text for proper contrast matching the Figma design
- Implemented proper spacing with container mx-auto and responsive padding (py-16 lg:py-24)
- Added Framer Motion animations with staggered delays for smooth entrance effects
