# Design Work
## ðŸ›  UI Implementation Overview
- Implemented split-screen layout with text content on left (56% width) and portrait image on right (44% width)
- Created responsive design that stacks vertically on mobile and maintains side-by-side layout on desktop
- Applied black background with white text for high contrast matching the Figma design
- Styled "ABOUT ME" heading with large typography (44px-88px responsive) and text stroke effects
- Added grayscale filter to portrait image to match the black-and-white aesthetic
- Implemented proper spacing with container padding and vertical alignment using flexbox
- Used Tailwind CSS utility classes for responsive breakpoints and consistent styling
- Added loading skeleton for image with smooth opacity transition when loaded

## ðŸ§  User-Defined Business Logic Summary
- Implemented content state management for dynamic text content (heading and description)
- Added image loading state tracking with progressive enhancement and loading skeleton
- Created responsive layout state handling transitions between desktop split-view and mobile stacked view
- Implemented lazy loading with intersection observer for performance optimization
- Added proper accessibility features including semantic HTML, alt text, and ARIA labels
- Structured component with main container and organized sub-sections for maintainability
- Applied responsive typography scaling for the large "ABOUT ME" heading across devices
- Designed for CMS integration support with structured content object

## ðŸ¤– Inferred Business Logic Summary (LLM)
- Integrated Framer Motion animations with useInView hook for scroll-triggered entrance effects
- Implemented staggered animation delays for text elements (0.2s, 0.4s, 0.6s) and image (0.3s)
- Added text stroke styling effects for both filled and outlined text variations
- Created viewport-based animation triggers with margin offset for better user experience
- Implemented proper error handling for image loading with fallback states
- Added ESLint disable comment for prop-types following project standards
- Used ref-based element targeting for intersection observer functionality
- Applied consistent animation variants pattern for organized motion effects

## âœ… Remaining Implementation Tasks
- Update image source path to match actual project asset structure
- Replace Lorem ipsum content with real about me text and description
- Verify custom font families (font-inter, font-goldman) are properly configured in Tailwind
- Test responsive behavior across all device breakpoints and adjust spacing if needed
- Integrate with CMS or props system for dynamic content management
- Optimize image assets for different screen densities and formats (WebP, AVIF)
- Add error boundary handling for image loading failures
- Validate accessibility compliance with screen readers and keyboard navigation
