# Design Work
## ðŸ›  UI Implementation Overview
- Implemented two-column responsive grid layout using Tailwind CSS grid system with lg:grid-cols-2
- Created large typography hierarchy with 88px heading using Inter font family and proper line heights
- Applied black background with white text to match the monochromatic design aesthetic
- Implemented grayscale filter on profile image to achieve black and white photography effect
- Added Framer Motion animations with staggered entrance effects for text and image elements
- Used fixed dimensions (704px height, 524px width) for image container to match design proportions
- Applied proper spacing with gap-8 lg:gap-16 and padding utilities for responsive layout
- Implemented transparent text stroke effect for "ME" text using WebkitTextStroke CSS property

## ðŸ§  User-Defined Business Logic Summary
- Two-column layout designed to stack vertically on mobile devices for responsive behavior
- Text content configured as placeholder Lorem ipsum suggesting template-based content management
- Image should be replaceable with actual profile/workspace photos for content flexibility
- Typography scales down appropriately for smaller screens maintaining text readability
- Image loading states handled with lazy loading and proper alt text for accessibility
- Content data designed to be passed as props for component reusability
- Image container handles different aspect ratios gracefully with object-cover styling
- Performance optimized with responsive image sizes and font loading considerations

## ðŸ¤– Inferred Business Logic Summary (LLM)
- Static content section with no interactive state management required
- Semantic HTML structure implemented with proper section and heading hierarchy
- Container pattern follows project standards with mx-auto and responsive padding
- Animation variants use Framer Motion with staggered delays for visual appeal
- Image asset imported using ES6 import syntax following project graphical asset standards
- Component follows functional component pattern with arrow function syntax
- Proper error handling for image loading with descriptive alt text
- Font families specified with fallbacks and custom styling properties

## âœ… Remaining Implementation Tasks
- Replace Lorem ipsum placeholder text with actual about me content
- Replace profileImage import path with actual profile/workspace photo asset
- Create unit test file using React Testing Library following project standards
- Configure custom fonts (Inter, Goldman) in Tailwind config if not already present
- Add proper TypeScript interfaces for props if converting to TypeScript
- Implement content management system integration for editable text content
- Add error boundary and loading states for image asset handling
- Test responsive behavior across different screen sizes and devices
