# Design Work
## ðŸ›  UI Implementation Overview
- Implemented responsive two-column layout using CSS Grid with left text content and right portrait image
- Created large "ABOUT ME" heading with outlined "ME" text using transparent color and white stroke border
- Applied dark theme with gray-900 background and white text following Figma design
- Integrated grayscale filter on portrait image to match black and white aesthetic
- Used Framer Motion for smooth entrance animations with staggered timing for title, text, and image
- Implemented mobile-first responsive design with stacked layout on smaller screens
- Added proper image lazy loading and accessibility attributes including meaningful alt text
- Applied Tailwind CSS utility classes with arbitrary values for precise spacing and typography

## ðŸ§  User-Defined Business Logic Summary
- Configurable text content through props with default Lorem ipsum fallback text
- Dynamic portrait image loading with support for custom image sources via props
- Responsive behavior with mobile stacking and tablet adaptations for different screen sizes
- Performance optimization through lazy loading implementation for the portrait image
- Accessibility features including semantic HTML structure and meaningful alt text
- Progressive enhancement ensuring text content loads before image content
- Component-level state management with props interface for aboutText and portraitImage
- Clean semantic HTML structure focused on reusability through configurable props

## ðŸ¤– Inferred Business Logic Summary (LLM)
- Framer Motion animation variants defined locally within component for entrance effects
- Staggered animation timing with title appearing first, followed by body text, then image
- Gradient overlay applied on mobile screens for better text contrast when content stacks
- Background decoration with gradient overlay for enhanced visual depth
- Object-fit cover positioning for consistent image display across different aspect ratios
- ESLint prop-types validation disabled following project conventions
- Default export pattern consistent with project structure standards
- Container and responsive grid system implementation using Tailwind utilities

## âœ… Remaining Implementation Tasks
- Update image import path to match actual project asset structure
- Configure custom fonts (Inter, Goldman) in Tailwind config if not already present
- Add component to main application routing or page structure
- Verify responsive breakpoints match project design requirements
- Test component with actual content and images in production environment
- Integrate with any existing cursor state management if used in other components
- Add any required theme switching functionality if multiple themes are supported
- Ensure proper error handling for missing or failed image loading scenarios
