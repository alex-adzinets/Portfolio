# Design Work
## ðŸ›  UI Implementation Overview
- Implemented two-column responsive grid layout with text content on left and portrait image on right
- Created prominent "ABOUT ME" heading using Inter font with mixed typography weights and AnimatedText component
- Applied black background with white text for dramatic contrast matching Figma design
- Implemented responsive breakpoints that stack columns vertically on mobile devices
- Added grayscale filter to portrait image to maintain black and white aesthetic
- Used Framer Motion for smooth fade-in animations and scaling effects
- Configured proper aspect ratio (524/704) for portrait image with object-fit cover
- Applied Goldman font for description text with proper line height and spacing

## ðŸ§  User-Defined Business Logic Summary
- Dynamic content loading capability through configurable props for title, description, and image
- Responsive behavior with two-column layout stacking vertically on mobile breakpoints
- Image optimization with lazy loading implementation for portrait image
- Progressive enhancement ensuring graceful content loading even if image fails
- Component designed as presentational receiving content via props from parent
- Semantic HTML structure with proper heading hierarchy for accessibility
- Performance considerations with lazy loading and error handling for failed image loads
- Dramatic contrast and typography hierarchy support through styling system

## ðŸ¤– Inferred Business Logic Summary (LLM)
- Separation of concerns with inner AboutMeSectionContent component accepting props and outer wrapper
- Default fallback values provided for all props ensuring component renders without external data
- Framer Motion animations with staggered timing for enhanced user experience
- CSS-in-JS styling with WebkitTextStroke for text effects matching design specifications
- Gradient overlay on image for improved text contrast and visual hierarchy
- Custom font loading through Google Fonts with Inter and Goldman typefaces
- Responsive typography using clamp() functions for fluid scaling across devices
- ESLint configuration with prop-types disabled following project standards

## âœ… Remaining Implementation Tasks
- Import and configure AnimatedText component dependency in the project
- Add the portrait image asset (13_7.png) to the assets directory
- Include AboutMeSectionStyles.css in the main application or component
- Configure Tailwind CSS to recognize custom font classes (font-inter, font-goldman)
- Set up proper image optimization and lazy loading infrastructure
- Integrate the component into the main portfolio page or routing system
- Add error boundary handling for failed image loads or missing dependencies
- Test responsive behavior across different device breakpoints and browsers
