# Design Work
## ðŸ›  UI Implementation Overview
- Implemented two-column responsive layout using CSS Grid with text content on left and portrait image on right
- Created large "ABOUT ME" heading with mixed styling - solid white "ABOUT" text and outlined black stroke "ME" text
- Applied black background with white text to match the monochromatic design aesthetic
- Integrated AnimatedText component for heading animations with fadeInRight/fadeInLeft effects
- Added grayscale filter to portrait image to maintain black and white visual consistency
- Implemented responsive breakpoints that stack content vertically on mobile devices
- Used custom CSS classes for precise typography matching Inter and Goldman fonts from design
- Added smooth hover effects and loading optimizations for enhanced user experience

## ðŸ§  User-Defined Business Logic Summary
- Dynamic content loading capability with configurable text content from CMS or props
- Responsive behavior that stacks content vertically on mobile with image scaling and typography adjustments
- Performance optimizations including lazy loading for portrait images and progressive enhancement
- Accessibility features with meaningful alt text, proper heading hierarchy, and focus management
- Reusable AboutSection component design accepting props for heading, description, image source and styling variants
- Content separated from presentation logic for easy updates without code changes
- Error boundaries and loading states for graceful handling of dynamic content and image failures
- Self-contained but flexible component design suitable for different contexts

## ðŸ¤– Inferred Business Logic Summary (LLM)
- Content data structure organized as configurable object with heading, description, imageUrl and imageAlt properties
- Animation system using AnimatedText component with staggered timing and directional effects
- CSS custom animations with fadeInUp keyframes for description text with delayed execution
- Responsive font sizing using clamp() function for fluid typography across device sizes
- Image optimization with object-cover positioning and overflow handling for consistent aspect ratios
- Mobile-first responsive design with order changes and spacing adjustments per breakpoint
- Custom CSS properties for text stroke effects and webkit compatibility
- Hover interactions on desktop with scale transforms and smooth transitions

## âœ… Remaining Implementation Tasks
- Import and configure the AnimatedText component dependency in the project
- Add the portrait image asset (13_7.png) to the correct assets directory
- Configure custom fonts (Inter, Goldman) in Tailwind config or ensure Google Fonts loading
- Import and apply the AboutMeSection.css stylesheet to the component
- Test responsive behavior across different device sizes and adjust spacing if needed
- Integrate the component into the main application routing or page structure
- Replace Lorem ipsum content with actual about me text and professional portrait
- Add proper error handling for missing image assets and content loading states
