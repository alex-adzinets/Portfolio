# Design Work
## ðŸ›  UI Implementation Overview
The implementation creates a header that overlaps with the first paragraph by using positioning techniques:

1. The header "Little About Me" is positioned with `relative z-10` to ensure it appears above other elements
2. The paragraph below has negative margin top (`-mt-6`) to move it up and overlap with the header
3. The paragraph also has padding top (`pt-8`) to create the necessary gap between the header and the actual text content

This creates the visual effect where the header appears to float above the paragraph while maintaining proper spacing between the header text and paragraph text. The implementation follows Tailwind CSS conventions used throughout the project, with appropriate font classes (font-ClashDisplay for the header, font-LandRover for the paragraph).

## ðŸ§  User-Defined Business Logic Summary
The implementation notes specified that the header should be displayed on top of the first paragraph (overlapping it) while maintaining a gap between the header and the first paragraph text. This visual arrangement creates a layered design where the header appears to float above the content while ensuring readability.

## ðŸ¤– Inferred Business Logic Summary (LLM)
The code implements cursor state management through mouse events, where hovering over the header or paragraph text changes the cursor state to 'onHover' and returns it to 'default' when the mouse leaves. The component is structured as a two-column grid on larger screens that collapses to a single column on smaller screens. The right column contains an AI chatbot assistant that allows users to interact and learn more about the developer.

## âœ… Remaining Implementation Tasks
The implementation successfully addresses the design instruction of having the header displayed on top of the first paragraph with a gap between them. No remaining tasks are needed for this specific requirement.
