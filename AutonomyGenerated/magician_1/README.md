# Design Work
## ðŸ›  UI Implementation Overview
- Implemented split-screen layout using CSS Grid with responsive breakpoints (lg:grid-cols-12)
- Created custom typography matching Figma design with Inter font for heading and Goldman for body text
- Applied text stroke effect to "ME" portion of heading using WebkitTextStroke for outline appearance
- Integrated Framer Motion animations with staggered entrance effects for title, content, and image
- Implemented responsive image handling with grayscale filter and proper aspect ratios
- Added mobile-first responsive design with vertical stacking on smaller screens
- Used Tailwind CSS utility classes for consistent spacing, colors, and layout structure
- Included error handling for image loading with SVG placeholder fallback

## ðŸ§  User-Defined Business Logic Summary
- Dynamic content loading capability through configurable props for text and image management
- Responsive behavior with mobile layout stacking and image scaling while maintaining aspect ratios
- Typography scaling across different breakpoints with appropriate spacing adjustments
- Accessibility considerations including descriptive alt text and semantic HTML structure
- Performance optimizations with lazy loading implementation for images
- Error boundary handling for graceful image loading failures
- Component structure designed to be self-contained but flexible for different contexts
- Focus on clean, accessible, and responsive implementation approach

## ðŸ¤– Inferred Business Logic Summary (LLM)
- Implemented staggered animation sequence using Framer Motion variants for enhanced user experience
- Added gradient overlay on mobile devices for better text contrast when content is stacked
- Integrated proper font family specifications matching design requirements (Inter and Goldman)
- Applied grayscale filter to image for consistent black and white aesthetic
- Implemented responsive grid system with absolute positioning for desktop layout optimization
- Added overflow handling and proper z-index management for layered content
- Included loading states and error handling for robust image display
- Structured component with semantic HTML elements for improved accessibility

## âœ… Remaining Implementation Tasks
- Add the required unit test file using React Testing Library following project conventions
- Import and configure custom fonts (Inter and Goldman) in the project's font configuration
- Create the actual image asset (./assets/13_7.png) or update the image path to existing asset
- Integrate the component into the main application routing and page structure
- Configure any necessary props interface if dynamic content management is required
- Test responsive behavior across different devices and screen sizes
- Verify accessibility compliance with screen readers and keyboard navigation
- Optimize image assets for different screen densities and formats
