# Design Work
## ðŸ›  UI Implementation Overview
- Implemented responsive two-column layout using CSS Grid with lg:grid-cols-12 for desktop and single column for mobile
- Created split "ABOUT ME" heading with solid white "ABOUT" and outlined transparent "ME" using webkit-text-stroke
- Applied grayscale filter to profile image to match the black and white aesthetic from Figma
- Used Framer Motion for entrance animations with staggered delays for text and image elements
- Implemented proper typography scaling with Inter font for headings and Goldman for body text
- Added loading states and error handling for the profile image with smooth opacity transitions
- Ensured mobile-first responsive design with proper spacing and typography adjustments
- Maintained black background with white text to match the dark theme from the design

## ðŸ§  User-Defined Business Logic Summary
- Static content state management with editable content support through props interface
- Responsive behavior handling desktop two-column, tablet adjusted spacing, and mobile vertical stack
- Image loading state management with loading, error, and loaded states for hero image
- Content management system integration capability through isEditable prop
- Accessibility considerations including proper alt text and heading hierarchy
- Performance optimizations with lazy loading and responsive image handling
- Component accepts heading, description, imageUrl, imageAlt, className, and isEditable props
- Single cohesive component approach without sub-component extraction as recommended

## ðŸ¤– Inferred Business Logic Summary (LLM)
- Text splitting logic to separate "ABOUT" and "ME" from heading prop for different styling
- Image error handling with fallback display message when image fails to load
- Smooth transition animations using Framer Motion with coordinated entrance timing
- Proper semantic HTML structure with section element and responsive grid layout
- Font loading optimization with font-display swap for better performance
- Custom CSS utilities for text stroke effects and font family applications
- Container-based responsive design with proper padding and margin handling
- Comprehensive unit testing coverage including image states and responsive behavior

## âœ… Remaining Implementation Tasks
- Import and configure the fonts.css file in the main application or index.html
- Add the actual profile image asset (13_7.png) to the assets directory
- Import and integrate the AnimatedText component if additional text animations are needed
- Configure Tailwind CSS to recognize the custom font utilities (font-inter, font-goldman)
- Test the component integration within the larger portfolio application
- Verify responsive behavior across different device breakpoints
- Ensure proper image optimization and srcset implementation for production
- Add any additional content management system integration if required
