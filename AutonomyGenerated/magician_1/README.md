# Design Work
## ðŸ›  UI Implementation Overview
- Implemented split-screen layout with 56/44 ratio matching Figma proportions using Flexbox
- Created responsive design with mobile-first approach: stacked layout on mobile, side-by-side on desktop
- Applied black background with white typography following design specifications
- Used Tailwind CSS utilities for consistent spacing, typography, and responsive breakpoints
- Implemented grayscale filter on portrait image to match black and white aesthetic
- Added proper image positioning with object-cover for consistent aspect ratio
- Applied Inter font for heading and Goldman font for body text matching design hierarchy
- Structured components following project PascalCase naming and functional component patterns

## ðŸ§  User-Defined Business Logic Summary
- Split-screen layout with 50/50 text-to-image ratio requirement for desktop view
- Responsive behavior with stacked layout for tablet/mobile breakpoints
- Component structure planning with separate AboutContent and AboutImage components
- Props interface planning for heading, bodyText, imageUrl, imageAlt, and className
- Performance optimizations including lazy loading and responsive image sizing
- Content management integration support for dynamic text and image content
- Accessibility considerations with proper heading hierarchy and alt text
